## Context 
- This application was completed independently in the 12th week of my software development program. It took approximately 35+ hours to complete the project. 
- Goals:
    1. Make network requests to get data, post data, and updated the DOM accordingly. 
    2. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD. 
    3. Use object and array prototype methods. 
    4. Develop a highly accessible application, verified with lighthouse and the WAVE extension. 
- Wins: 
    1. Efficiently organized functions in separate files.
    2. Use of a public API to display real-time weather report. 
    3. Utilized pull request template and project board issues to stay organized throughout duration of project. 
    4. Developed testing suites with sad paths.
    5. Managed error handling with both POST and GET network requests. 
- Challenges:
    1. Interpreting provided data set to display dates and trips in a meaningful context. 
    2. Continued bugs with login page and form.

## Future Improvements 
- Utilize SASS for CSS styling. 
- Incorporate local/session storage to maintain displayed booked trips after logging out.
